                        <p>What is the Key Principles for Social Media Managers:
                            Social media is about conversations, community, connecting with the audience and building relationships. It is not just a broadcast channel or a sales and marketing tool.
                            Authenticity, honesty and open dialogue are key.
                            Social media not only allows you to hear what people say about you, but enables you to respond. Listen first, speak second.
                            Be compelling, useful, relevant and engaging. Don’t be afraid to try new things, but think through your efforts before kicking them off.</p>

                            For starters, the purpose of HR is to provide the structure for your organization and serves as the engine that keeps it running smoothly on a daily basis.
                            It’s vital for establishing and maintaining structure and consistency across your company. 
                            Your organization, regardless of its size, needs an HR presence – one that goes beyond the minimum, day-to-day requirements, though these are critically important. Your HR presence should include the strategic element that can help your organization achieve its goals and successfully take it into the future.
